Stress and Anxiety Level Predictor

Description: Developed a machine learning model using Python to predict stress and anxiety levels based on various physiological and psychological factors. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of several predictive algorithms to achieve optimal accuracy. Key responsibilities included:

Data Collection: Gathered data from various sources, including surveys and wearable devices.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.
Feature Engineering: Extracted and selected relevant features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Model Implementation: Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to identify the best performing model.
Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: Deployed the model using a web-based interface for easy access and usability.
Tools and Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask (for deployment).

Outcome: Achieved an accuracy of 91% in predicting stress and anxiety levels, providing valuable insights for mental health management and intervention strategies.
